# From Multidimensional Poverty Index by block to average by urban neighborhood using free data from foursquare.
A case Study in Medell√≠n city, Colombia
Final coursera capstone project- IBM DATA SCIENCE-PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE

1. INTRODUCTION
Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) looks beyond income to understand how people experience poverty in multiple and simultaneous ways. It identifies how people are being left behind across three key dimensions: health, education and standard of living, comprising 10 indicators. People who experience deprivation in at least one third of these weighted indicators fall into the category of multidimensional poor.
1.1 PROBLEM
The Medellin city, uses this index by every block in the urban city, according to the last census data, but it is without information about every neighborhood. In addition, it does not have data about any relationship with principal venues around every neighborhood.
Taking in count the previous information, now the major question is: could the closer venues from each neighborhood has a relationship with poverty and with this data is possible to do prediction like an approximation to Multidimensional Poverty Index?
Using Machine learning and foursquare free data, we will try to resolve this!!!
